```

## Build

Go to the plugin-tools folder and run the "./start" script.
```shell
cd plugin-tools  # go to plugin folder
./start.sh       # run the script start.sh
```
The script will build a docker image and attach a console.
When the docker image is running go to the "app-plugin-kiln" folder and build the ".elf" files.
```shell
cd app-plugin-kiln/tests        # go to the tests folder in app-plugin-kiln
./build_local_test_elfs.sh      # run the script build_local_test_elfs.sh
```

## Tests

To test the plugin go to the tests folder from the "app-plugin-kiln/tests" and run the script "test"
```shell
cd app-plugin-kiln/tests        # go to the tests folder in app-plugin-kiln
yarn                            # install dependencies
yarn test                       # run the script test
```

## Continuous Integration

The flow processed in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is the following:

- Code formatting with [clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
